                    <p>Hello everyone! This post will have a bit of a backstory to it... So as was discussed in my about page, I recently graduated from Champlain College. There, I became very interested in malware, and a skill that I do not have yet under my belt is reversing. I have taken a small 1 credit class on the subject, but as I am graduated, I will be primarily teaching myself (as well as the great classes from the brilliant minds behind the open security training 2).</p>
										
					<p>One of the things I will be doing to get better at reversing is learning a bit of assembly programming. I also sense it will help with some of my offensive security journey. That being said, this post will be about how to write a simple "hello world" program in assembly! For the record, this will be using 32-bit Intel syntax. I will probably graduate to other architectures but for now, this is where I am starting. </p>
								
					<p>I wanted to write this post on the subject because I feel one of the best ways to get better at something is to teach folks how to actually do it. So let's get started with the post.</p>
					
					<p>Before we get into the thick of it, I wanted to mention that I will be compiling  this using a 32 bit version of Ubuntu. I will end up compiling it as an ELF file, as this is a linux executable file, and it will be a simple CLI program. Nothing special. I will be using vim as an IDE for this, because vim is OP.</p>
					
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Defining Sections</h2>

					<p>The way assembly works is you need to define different sections, and each section will have its own role. For this simple program, we will need to define two sections, being the .text and the .data sections. The .text section is for the actual instructions we are passing to the processor, while the .data section is for defining our data which will be processed by our instructions, in this case, a couple variables. This is a simple thing to do. What it will consist of doing is just writing the .text and .data sections. We will then add things below them. </p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/coding/images/img1.png" alt="">
                    </a>
					
                    <p> Then, I will need to define where the execution starts. I will be using global start in this case. This is essentially specifying the entry point to the program. Before the .text section. I need to specify global start by adding the Global_ start text. Then, before all of my code in the .text section, I will add the _start:. This needs to be before the code because the _start: is essentially a symbol recognized by the system to initialize the program start, invoke syscalls, and execute program logic.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Writing the Program</h2>

                    <p>After this, I will go ahead and define my variables. This will be done in the .data section. I want to define two different variables. The first is the actual text that we want to print to the screen. This will be a simple "Hello, Cyberyom viewers!" message. To do this, you should write the name of the variable that you wish to define, in my case, it will be 'hello'. In assembly, you wont set it as equal like in different languages, but you will use "db", which stands for "define bytes". This is essentially setting the variable "Hello" to whatever you want the variable to be equal to. Then you will define the string that the variable will represent in between quotes. Now, this will be followed by 0xA. This is hex for 10. In assembly, we need to use 0xA for a line break. You can use python to see what it represents, or simply run man ascii, which would be \n (linebreak). The next variable I will define is "hello_length". We will come back to exactly why we need to define this later, but to do this, there are really two ways. The first is to count how many bytes are used in the "hello" string, but this can be a little inconsistent, and hard depending on the size of the string. The way we will do it is by taking the "hello" string, and just setting a new variable to the length of that string. To do this, instead of using db (define bytes), we will use equ, which is used as equal. Then, we will throw the characters "$ -" after to specify that we want the length of the contents of a variable. After this, we will add the variable to which we want the length of. The picture below will outline what was just said</p>

                        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/coding/images/img2.png" alt="">
                    </a>

					<p>Ok sweet, now we have all the variables we need defined. Our .data section is done. First a string to actually print to the screen, and then also the length of the string defined in a separate variable. Now, we need to start working with the .text section. The way assembly works is it has various instructions that are used to interact with the processor. I will cover two in this post. The first is the mov instruction, and the second is the int instruction. The mov instruction essentially moves data around memory, to different registrars and such like that. We will use that the most. The second instruction is the int instruction, this is the interrupt instruction. Int will essentially interrupt the flow of instruction sent to the processor. It takes one parameter, which is an interrupt number. Different numbers will allow for different things, and we will get more into which interrupt number I will use here when the time comes. </p>

                    <p> Ok cool, we know the instructions we will use, and we have defined the variables that will be used in our program. Now to actually start doing things.</p>

                    <p>One thing to remember is that this is a 32 bit intel program. It will be different based on your CPU architecture, meaning if you write in in a x64 bit syntax, it will not work on a 32 bit system, or if you write in in Intel syntax, it will not work on Arm based systems. To start, the first thing we will want to do is write the syscall needed to write data to the first memory register, eax. To do this, we need to know the value for the write syscall. For this, we can reference the unistd_32.h file. This is simply a help file that defines all the syscalls and what their associated value is. You can find it at a github repository <a href="https://github.com/spotify/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/include/asm/unistd_32.h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, or reference the screenshot below. </p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/coding/images/img3.png" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p> As can be seen, the write syscall has the value 0x4. Cool! Time to write our first instruction! We will need to move this value to the eax value. The syntax for this is fairly simple, it is simply mov eax, 0x4. Make sure the comma is added! Now, syscalls typically will have parameters that need to be passed to them. In this case, the write syscall has 3 that need to be defined (on Ubuntu, this can be checked with the command man 2 write, where 2 will specify the linux programmer's manual). The 3 parameters are the file descriptor, the data to be written, and the length of the data (this is why we needed to define it in the .data section (: ). Seems easy enough. As mentioned, the first one is the file descriptor. File descriptor will tell the system how to use the data defined in the other parameters (I believe, please correct me if I am wrong, as I am still learning). Feel free to check this reference to read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. In this case, we want to use 1, which is for standard output. This will essentially tell the system to write the bytes descripted in the 3rd parameter from the variable defined in the 2nd variable, to the standard output, which is the terminal by default. The second parameter is the value we actually want to write, which is the "hello" variable. And the third parameter is the length of what is being written, which is the "hello_length" variable. These parameters will all need to be passed to different memory registers, which will be ebx, ecx, and edx, and use the same syntax as writing the write syscall to eax. </p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/coding/images/img4.png" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p>After this, we will need to interrupt what is happening. As I mentioned, the int instruction is used to interrupt the flow of execution of the program, so since we already pushed all of the parameters needed for the write syscall, we will now use this. It will look like int 0x80. As can be seen, I used 0x80 as the interrupt number. This is the interrupt call for a software interrupt, rather than a traditional hardware interrupt. It is also known as a syscall interrupt, which is essentially what I will be using. </p>

                    <p> Cool! We have most of the code done now! There is however one more thing we will want to do. We don't want the program to hang after it prints the text to the screen, so we will need to call the syscall for a graceful exit. This can be checked in the unistd_32.h file, but to save time, I will tell you that the value for the exit syscall is 0x1. Because we invoked the int call, the stack has been executed and cleared, meaning we can now push values to eax again. So, the same way we did for the write syscall, we will write "mov eax, 0x1" to the eax register. We will however want to push a value to eax, which is 0, as per convention. We want to do this because the exit syscall requires a return value, and we will pass 0 as a successful execution. After this, we will again run the interrupt instruction with the 0x80 interrupt number, and then it is done! </p>

                    <p> The finalized code can be seen below! </p>

                    </a>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Compiling the Program</h2>
					 
					<p>	Ok cool, we have our program written. Now, we need to actually compile it. To do this, first you will convert it to an object file, as mentioned. First, we need to install the package for nasm. On Ubuntu, the way to do this will be the command: sudo pacman -S nasm. Now, you will need to run the command: nasm -f elf hello.asm. This will save our program as hello.o. </p>

                    <p> Once you have this, you need to install binutils. You can do this (again, I am on Ubuntu) by running the command: sudo pacman -S binutils </p>

                    <p> Once it is installed you need to run the command: ld -m elf_i386 -s -o hello hello.o </p>

                    <p> This will make a binary file named hello. Now that it is an ELF file and this can be confirmed with the command: file hello </p>

                    <P> We need to make it executable. This can be done with the command: sudo chmod +x hello. This will make the file executable and will allow you to run it! Run it with the command: ./hello. And there you go! You will see your message! </p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/coding/images/img6.png" alt="">
                    </a>

					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Closing Remarks</h2>
					
					<p>Well, that was cool! As I get better at programming in assembly I will probably share more things. Probably they will be related to malware in some way, as that is my primary interest, and the whole point of me even learning this was to get better at reversing malware. I hope you learned something new from this! I am currently in no way a programmer, and so it was great fun to learn how to do this. If you have any questions, or if I got anything wrong, I would be more than happy to talk more on twitter (X), or Linkedin, so feel free to reach out! I have added the code to a github repository, called ... . Feel free to pull it down if you don't want to write the program! </p>
