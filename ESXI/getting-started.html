		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After recently moving (and buying and selling servers), I have been left without a homelab setup for around a month now, and lacking the time to actually get building! As I lay in bed on a restless night, I figured that there is no better time to start this, than now, at 1:30 in the morning. Who doesn&#39;t do their best work in the wee hours of the morning, right?</p>

		<p class="c2">
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have a lot of cool projects I want to start doing and working on (some of which will be mentioned here so stay tuned! (: &nbsp;), so I figured I would actually build out what I have. I have a Dell PowerEdge r710. To be honest, I haven&#39;t actually ever turned it on, so i&#39;m not exactly sure what is inside it, but previously I had a Cisco c250m server, and I bought this one for a lot cheaper, with a lot more storage, and the bonus feature that it doesn&#39;t sound like a jet engine when you turn it on. Speaking of which, if anyone wants a Cisco c250m server, I have an extra lying around!</span>

			<span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My physical setup is not that cool to be honest, I leave my server inside my closet on the floor (and a bin is actually sitting on top of it!) just to keep it out of the way. I don&#39;t think there will be any heating issues as long as I keep an eye on it, but ill have to play it by ear. I&#39;ll attach a picture down below!</span>

			<span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I haven&#39;t even powered the server up yet (except one time to compare the sound levels), the Dell doesn&rsquo;t have an OS on it. How to choose an os though&hellip;? I&#39;ll add some of my thoughts below, and if anyone else has any that I missed, feel free to tweet at me!</span>

			<span class="c5">When choosing how you want to set your homelab up, there are a few things to consider. First, you need to decide what kind of hypervisor you will use. There are two types of hypervisors, </span><span class="c7">type 1 </span><span class="c5">and </span><span class="c7">type 2</span><span class="c1">. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c2 c4">
			<span class="c1">A type 1 hypervisor is an operating system that you would typically install on a server (or an old pc/laptop!), and it usually requires much less resources to actually run. This will give you more resources to use for your VMs! There are a couple of other pros to a type 1 hypervisor as well, but a big con is that you have to sacrifice a system for this, so if you only have 1 PC or laptop, perhaps a type 2 hypervisor would be better. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0 c4">
			<span class="c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c2 c4">
			<span class="c1">A type 2 hypervisor sits on an OS and lets you run VMs from your desktop. Some popular examples of type 2 hypervisors are VMware Workstation and VirtualBox. Workstation does need a license while VirtualBox is completely free to download and set up, just watch a network chuck video or something. These are good because they&#39;re pretty quick to set up, and easy to interface and manage, but if you want something that will either always be running, or want to do some more advanced configurations, I would go with a type 1 hypervisor.</span>

			<span class="c6 c5">Choosing your path</span>
		</h1>
		<p class="c2">
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose to go with ESXi 6.5. This was mostly because the server I currently have can&#39;t really go higher, to my knowledge. I chose ESXi over other type 1 hypervisors such as Proxmox and KVM for two main reasons. First, I have a lot of experience in ESXi, not so much in the management side of things, but when I went to school, we always used VMware vSphere and Workstation. The second is because (though I am not sure about KVM because I have never used it) Proxmox doesn&rsquo;t have the same networking capabilities that ESXi has. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="c0">
			<span class="c1"></span>
		</p>
		<p class="c2">
			<span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ESXi allows you to do things that Proxmox could; create virtual switches and port groups. This is super good because it allows you to get super deep with your networking. I mapped out a general network map on a sticky note today that involves multiple virtual routers at work for my lab env, as well as segmenting it from other personal services I will run on the platform, like a Pi-Hole. This blog won&rsquo;t be about my personal services however, more on my lab setup. </span>

			<span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First I needed an ISO, which was not easy to find, but I was able to get it from a buddy of mine, so I was able to get started! I used a popular flashing tool called </span><span class="c7">Rufus</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to flash a USB stick with the ISO image. I attached an image of how I configured Rufus below for anyone curious</span>

			<span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, I stuck the USB into the server, booted it up, assigned it a static IP in my home router (which will be picked up via my router&#39;s DHCP service), and boom! ESXi is ready to go!</span>

			<span class="c5">I immediately noticed that the server has just under 50 GB of RAM. I never really checked or asked (my buddy sold it to me for </span><span class="c5 c13">really</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;cheap) but this is fine. I suspect that soon I will post about a memory upgrade (I have around 96 GB lying around)</span>

			<span class="c1">I think this will be enough for tonight. My next post will be concerning putting all of my drives in RAID (which I understand but have not done before!). I believe this has 7 900 GB drives, so if you have any suggestions for which RAID method to use, I am all ears! Otherwise, I will base my decision on the research I conduct on the subject. I will also probably talk about uploading VMs to the datastore(s) created in the RAID process and spinning up my first few VMs. </span>
