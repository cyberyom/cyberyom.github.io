                    <p>	After recently moving (and buying and selling servers), I have been left without a homelab setup for around a month now, and lacking the time to actually get building! As I lay in bed on a restless night, I figured that there is no better time to start this, than now, at 1:30 in the morning. Who doesn't do their best work in the wee hours of the morning, right?</p>

                    <p>Well, we'll have to see...</p>

                    <p>I do have a lot of cool projects I want to start doing and working on (some of which will be mentioned here so stay tuned! (:  ), so I figured I would actually build out what I have. I have a Dell PowerEdge r710. To be honest, I haven't actually ever turned it on, so I'm not exactly sure what is inside it, but previously I had a Cisco c250m server, and I bought this one for a lot cheaper, with a lot more storage, and the bonus feature that it doesn't sound like a jet engine when you turn it on. Speaking of which, if anyone wants a Cisco c250m server, I have an extra lying around! </p>

                    <p>My physical setup is not that cool to be honest, I leave my server inside my closet on the floor (and a bin is actually sitting on top of it!) just to keep it out of the way. I don't think there will be any heating issues as long as I keep an eye on it, but I'll have to play it by ear.</p>

                    <p>Since I haven't even powered the server up yet (except one time to compare the sound levels), the Dell doesn’t have an OS on it. How to choose an os though…? I'll add some of my thoughts below, and if anyone else has any that I missed, feel free to tweet at me!</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Type 1 vs Type 2</h2>

                    <p>When choosing how you want to set your homelab up, there are a few things to consider. First, you need to decide what kind of hypervisor you will use. There are two types of hypervisors, type 1 and type 2. </p>

                    <p>A type 1 hypervisor is an operating system that you would typically install on a server (or an old pc/laptop!), and it usually requires much less resources to actually run. This will give you more resources to use for your VMs! There are a couple other pros to a type 1 hypervisor as well, but a big con is that you have to sacrifice a system for this, so if you only have 1 PC or laptop, perhaps a type 2 hypervisor would be better. </p>

                    <p>A type 2 hypervisor sits on an OS and lets you run VMs from your desktop. Some popular examples of type 2 hypervisors are VMware Workstation and Virtual Box. Workstation does need a license while Virtual Box is completely free to download and set up, just watch a network chuck video or something. These are good because they're pretty quick to set up, and easy to interface and manage, but if you want something that will either always be running, or want to do some more advanced configurations, I would go with a type 1 hypervisor.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Choosing your path</h2>

                    <p>I chose to go with ESXI 6.5. This was mostly because the server I currently have can't really go higher, to my knowledge. I chose ESXI over other type 1 hypervisors such as Proxmox and KVM for two main reasons. First, I have a lot of experience in ESXI, not so much in the management side of things, but when I went to school, we always used vmware vsphere and workstation. The second is because (though I am not sure about KVM because I have never used it) Proxmox doesn’t have the same networking capabilities that ESXI has. </p>
					
					<p>ESXI allows you to do things that Proxmox could; create virtual switches and port groups. This is super good because it allows you to get super deep with your networking. I mapped out a general network map on a sticky note today that involves multiple virtual routers at work for my lab env, as well as segmenting it from other personal services I will run on the platform, like a Pi-Hole. This blog won’t be about my personal services however, more on my lab setup.</p>
					
					<h2 class="section-heading">Installing ESXI</h2>
					
					<p>First I needed an ISO, which was not easy to find, but I was able to get it from a buddy of mine, so I was able to get started! I used a popular flashing tool called Rufus to flash a USB stick with the ISO image. I attached an image of how I configured rufus below for anyone curious</p>

                        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/ESXI/img/rufus.png" alt="">
                    </a>
					
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Rufus configurations</span>

                    <p>After this, I stuck the USB into the server, booted it up, assigned it a static IP in my home router (which will be picked up via my router's DHCP service), and boom! ESXI is ready to go!</p>

                    <p>I immediately noticed that the server has just under 50 gb of ram. I never really checked or asked (my buddy sold it to me for really cheap) but this is fine. I suspect that soon I will post about a memory upgrade (I have around 96 GB lying around)</p>

                    <p>I think this will be enough for tonight. My next post will be concerning putting all of my drives in RAID (which I understand, but have not done before!). I believe this has 7 900 GB drives, so if you have any suggestions for which RAID method to use, I am all ears! Otherwise, I will base my decision off the research I conduct on the subject. I will also probably talk about uploading VMs to the datastore(s) created in the RAID process, and spinning up my first few VMs.</p>
					
					<p>To end the post, I will leave this with a proposed network map for my lab environment, sort of a roadmap for this page. As always, please leave me your thoughts, either on discord or twitter!
